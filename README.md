# ✈️ Airline Flight Data – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores an airline flight dataset to uncover insights into flight durations, pricing patterns, route popularity, and airline performance.  
It answers **10 business questions** using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, and SQL queries**.

2. Which source–destination city pairs have the longest average duration?  
3. How many flights are recorded per airline and class (Business vs Economy)?  
4. Which departure time of day has the longest average durations?  
5. Which airlines operate the least number of unique routes?  
6. Do non-stop flights cost more than connecting ones for the same route?  
7. What are the top 5 most frequent flight routes?  
8. Which source cities have the most departures?  
9. Do last-minute bookings cost more than early bookings?  
10. Do certain airlines dominate specific routes or regions?
